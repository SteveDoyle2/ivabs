**iVABS**, standing for integrated VABS, is a versatile design framework for composite slender structures such as helicopter rotor blades, wind turbine blades, high aspect ratio wings, bridges, shafts, etc. This framework bundles **PreVABS**, **VABS**, **GEBT**ï¼Œ**Dakota**.

**PreVABS** is a versatile preprocessor to generate detailed composite sections based on a few design parameters including sectional geometry, topology, and material. 

**VABS** is a world-known cross-sectional analysis code based on decades of  university research (Georgia Tech/Utah State/Purdue) commercialized by `AnalySwift LLC <https://analyswift.com/>`_, to model composite slender structures as beams. 

bundles  **PreVABS + VABS + gmsh + msgpi + GEBT 
+ Dakota(optional)** . **PreVABS** is a parametrized composite design tool. 
**VABS** is a commercial code for cross-sectional property analysis. **msgpi**
is a Python interface for **VABS**. **GEBT** is a beam structural analysis tool.
**PreVABS**, **VABS**, **msgpi**, and **GEBT**  are developed in Prof. Yu's 
group. **Gmsh** is an open source CAD software. **Dakota** is an open source 
tool for optimization developed by Sandia national lab.
