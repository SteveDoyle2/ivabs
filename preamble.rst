iVABS (namely integrated VABS), is a design framework for composite slender structures such as helicopter rotor blades, wind turbine blades, high aspect ratio wings, bridges, shafts, etc. This framework bundles PreVABS, VABS, GEBT, Dakota, along with scripts for integration among these codes and other related codes. All the codes are open source except VABS which is commerical code and a license can be requested from AnalySwift. PreVABS, VABS, GEBT, and integration scripts are developed by Prof. Wenbin Yuâ€™s research group. Dakota is developed by the Sandia National Lab.

PreVABS is a versatile preprocessor to generate detailed composite sections based on a few design parameters including sectional geometry, topology, and material.

VABS is a world-known cross-sectional analysis code to to model composite slender structures as beams. It is based on decades of university research (Georgia Tech/Utah State/Purdue) sponsored by US Army.

GEBT is a geometrical exact nonlinear beam analysis code for computing linear or nonlinear, static or dynamic behavior of composite beams. This code can be replaced with more sophicated codes such as MBDyn, RCAS, DYMORE, etc.

Dakota is a multilevel, parallel, object-oriented framework for design optimization, parameter estimation, uncertainty quantification, and sensitivity analysis.
